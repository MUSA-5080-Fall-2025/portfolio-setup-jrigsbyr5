The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd\n      text: \"Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)\n\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Set your Census API key\n\n# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state\n\nmy_state = \"California\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **[California]** for this analysis because: [California has vast geographical,economic and demographical variation by region and by municipality. It seems there is a huge potential for algorithmic bias to present itself in that region of the country, given the wide disparities that exist at almost every level.]\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\n\ncalifornia_acs_data = get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  state = my_state,\n  variables = c(median_household_income = \"B19013_001\", total_population = \"B01003_001\"),\n  year = 2022,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n\ncleaned_california_acs_data = california_acs_data %>%\n  mutate(county = NAME %>%\n      str_remove(\" County, California\")\n  )\n\n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\n\n# Display the first few rows\n\nglimpse(cleaned_california_acs_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 58\nColumns: 7\n$ GEOID                    <chr> \"06001\", \"06003\", \"06005\", \"06007\", \"06009\", …\n$ NAME                     <chr> \"Alameda County, California\", \"Alpine County,…\n$ median_household_incomeE <dbl> 122488, 101125, 74853, 66085, 77526, 69619, 1…\n$ median_household_incomeM <dbl> 1231, 17442, 6048, 2261, 3875, 5745, 1496, 43…\n$ total_populationE        <dbl> 1663823, 1515, 40577, 213605, 45674, 21811, 1…\n$ total_populationM        <dbl> NA, 206, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ county                   <chr> \"Alameda\", \"Alpine\", \"Amador\", \"Butte\", \"Cala…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  -

It seems that the Black/Affrican American data is less reliable.]\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n[Your integrated 4-paragraph summary here\n\nA general theme among all the analysis was that all of the data included relatively alarming amounts of margin of error. The highest margins of error where correlated with higher median income counties, and with counties that had a high percentage of white people. In the race data summary, there was not a single tract that did not have quality issues, so at this level there seems to be problematic data among all the communities and demographics from the analyses.\n\nIt seems that the communities that face the greates risk for algorithmic bias based on the findings are white people where they exist at a higher population percentage, african americans where they exist in a lower population percentage, and higher median household income caounties.\n\nIt would seem that given the most affected communities and demographics, that factors most influencing  data quality issues and bias are income level, and race, which both have subsets of explanatory factors. When dealing with income data, income is not necearsily reflective of an individuals economic stability, it is just the capital recived before money goes out so there is alot of variability there. With race it is well known that generational, historical, and societal factors lead to the dispersion of racial groups to different places.\n\nFor the department to address these systematic issues, it would be benefical to group median household income with an additional differentiation factor such as: amount of debt, properties at risk of forclosure, and number of people in the household to see if overlap in these areas could explain high margins of error.]\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\ncalifornia_data_reliability_summary_2 = california_data_reliability %>%\n  group_by(county) %>%\n  summarize(\n    median_income = mean(median_household_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE),       \n    moe_percentage = mean(median_income_moe, na.rm = TRUE),  \n    reliability = first(income_reliability)       \n  )%>%\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

For these counties algorthmic decisions are safe to be made as there is a high confidence in the data.]\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [Amador, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Inyo, Lassen, Mariposa, Modoc, San Benito, Tehama,Tuolumne. These counties need to be assesed with caution, outcomes should be monitored and retested for bias.]\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [Alpine, Mono, Plumas, Sierra, Trinity\nThese counties present low confidence of reliability and need to be reassessed before their data is used. Manual review, more surveying, and assessment of recent or impending societal or economic changes in the area should be carried out.]\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[1. Once this data is collected by the Census Bureau, what methods are most effective to remedy low reliability.\n\n2. How do you account for obvious impending large scale societal disruptions like covid and economic recessions.]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [9/21/25]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [4.5.1]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-jrigsbyr5/]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n[The biggest thing I noticed with data processing is that if you continuously alter the same data table than you are left with an extremely filtered and grouped table, so I made sure to assign changes to a new table at every step, even if they were very minor. ]\n\n**Limitations:**\n[Next time I may opt for a more narrow field than county. If you want to investigate influence on a smaller scale to identify the cause of a specific trend you can not change geographic scale at all with just one field.]\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
