Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold) 2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\nYour Task:\n\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n# First make income categories\n\nacs_tracts = acs_tracts %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    income_category = case_when(\n      median_incomeE &lt; 50000 ~ \"Low\",\n      median_incomeE &gt;= 50000 & median_incomeE &lt;= 60000 ~ \"Moderate\",\n      median_incomeE &gt; 60000 ~ \"High\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_  \n    )\n  )\n\n# Create percentages for populations over 65\n\nacs_tracts = acs_tracts %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct_over_65 = (over_65 / total_popE) * 100\n  )\n\n# I want to get the mean and median and range for pct_over_65 to decide what threshold to choose.\n\nacs_tracts %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # added because of an error\n  summarise(\n    mean_pct_over_65 = mean(pct_over_65, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median_pct_over_65 = median(pct_over_65, na.rm = TRUE),\n    min_pct_over_65 = min(pct_over_65, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_pct_over_65 = max(pct_over_65, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n  mean_pct_over_65 median_pct_over_65 min_pct_over_65 max_pct_over_65\n1         19.03108           18.95003               0             100\n\n#Filter for both categories\n\nvulnerable_tracts = acs_tracts %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    median_incomeE &lt; 50000,   \n    pct_over_65 &gt;= 25         \n  )\n\nQuestions to answer: - What income threshold did you choose and why?

This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis - Data: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) - Question: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?” - Operations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density - Policy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\nOption B: School Safety Zones - Data: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network - Question: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?” - Operations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage - Policy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity - Data: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics) - Question: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?” - Operations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - Policy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment —\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources - Data: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - Question: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?” - Operations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - Policy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies —\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility - Data: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) - Question: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?” - Operations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - Policy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health - Data: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics) - Question: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?” - Operations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators - Policy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage - Data: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings - Question: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?” - Operations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas - Policy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution - Data: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods - Question: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?” - Operations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups - Policy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources: - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers.

Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n# Load your additional dataset\n\nneighborhoods = st_read(\"data/philadelphia-neighborhoods.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `philadelphia-neighborhoods' from data source \n  `/Users/JoshuaRigsby 1/Desktop/Upenn/MUSA_5080_Public Policy_Analytics/Portfolio_Files/portfolio-setup-jrigsbyr5/labs/assignment_2/data/philadelphia-neighborhoods.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 159 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.28026 ymin: 39.86701 xmax: -74.95576 ymax: 40.13799\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\npublic_art = st_read(\"data/percent_for_art_public.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `percent_for_art_public' from data source \n  `/Users/JoshuaRigsby 1/Desktop/Upenn/MUSA_5080_Public Policy_Analytics/Portfolio_Files/portfolio-setup-jrigsbyr5/labs/assignment_2/data/percent_for_art_public.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 239 features and 13 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.25883 ymin: 39.8764 xmax: -75.09908 ymax: 40.08824\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\nhistoric_sites = st_read(\"data/historic_sites_philreg.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `historic_sites_philreg' from data source \n  `/Users/JoshuaRigsby 1/Desktop/Upenn/MUSA_5080_Public Policy_Analytics/Portfolio_Files/portfolio-setup-jrigsbyr5/labs/assignment_2/data/historic_sites_philreg.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 23375 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.25813 ymin: 39.87172 xmax: -74.96933 ymax: 40.12603\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\nlandmarks = st_read(\"data/Landmark_Points.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `Landmark_Points' from data source \n  `/Users/JoshuaRigsby 1/Desktop/Upenn/MUSA_5080_Public Policy_Analytics/Portfolio_Files/portfolio-setup-jrigsbyr5/labs/assignment_2/data/Landmark_Points.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 1147 features and 20 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.28169 ymin: 39.85929 xmax: -74.96915 ymax: 40.11991\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\nst_crs(neighborhoods)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nst_crs(public_art)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nst_crs(historic_sites)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nst_crs(landmarks)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\n\nQuestions to answer: - What dataset did you choose and why? I chose neighborhood boundries, public art, landmarks, and historic sites to identify neighborhoods that have better access to cultural amenities and neighborhoods that lack cultural amenities. - What is the data source and date? Source for all data sets: OpenDataPhilly - https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/, public art: July 2, 2020, neighborhood boundaries: July 2, 2020, landmarks: 11/01/2017, historic sites: N/A\n- How many features does it contain? neighborhoods = 159, public art = 239, landmarks = 1147, historic sites = 23375 - What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it? They are all in EPSG 4326, no need to transform.\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWhat neighborhoods in Philadelphia lack access and proximity to cultural amenities?\nExamples: - “Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?” - “Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?” - “Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\n\nConduct

showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\nYour interpretation: Upon looking at the interactive map it is evident that the Rittenhouse neighborhood has the greatest access to cultural amenities. My initial question was which neighborhoods lacked exposure and access to cultural amenities but upon doing the analysis it is evident that, nearly all of the neighborhoods in Philadelphia have a relatively low amount of cultural features, compared to neighborhoods in the city center. Objectively there may be many cultural features per neighborhood compared to other large cities in pennslyvania, but the only comparison we have here is within Philadelphia. The neighborhoods in Philadelphia following Rittenhouse with the greatest access to cultural amenities are: Old City, Society Hill, Spring Garden, Washington Square, Logan square and Graduate Hospital. It is not surprising that this concentration exists in and near the city center."
